% \section{Introduction}
%
% This toolbox is for the solution of ordinary differential equations,
% including initial value problems, boundary value problems etc. for
% example the toolbox can also be applied to Sturm-Liouville problems.
%
% This toolbox requires the DOPbox which cab be found at:

% \textbf{http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40531}
% \vspace{5mm}
%
% The ODEbox uses many of the functions available in DOPBox.
%
% The application of the toolbox to initial value, boundary value and
% Sturm-liouville problems is documented in a total of seven (7) example
% files. Please see these files for details of solving such problems.
%
% Additionally the ODEbox makes a tool available for the solution of
% initial value problems it has been given the name \lstinline{odeSolveIVP.m}
% This tool gives a very simple possability to solve linear initial value
% problems with both constant and variable coefficients. Please see the 
% specific examples and documentation to see how the tool can be used.
