%% Mining Economic Analysis
% To mine or not to mine? In recent times, a very important multimillion or billion dollar question to ask.  Would you trust making this decision without the proper research to know the future economic potential of a mine?  Or perhaps more importantly, what’s the risk of making a decision without having the research backed up by detailed models that forecast potential outcomes?  
% This webinar will highlight:
% •	Net Present Value Distribution Analysis of a mine
% •	Modelling & Simulation of future Prices & Interest rate paths
% •	Risk Assessment based on distribution of economic outcomes.
% In this webinar we aim to showcase how MATLAB can be used to develop and formalise a process for more detailed modelling of the future economic cash flow of a mine.  We will show how existing spreadsheet solutions, that use “Average Values” or “Simplistic distributions” which haven’t been modelled, can be replaced by models that are based on actual historical data that produce distributions of possible economic outcomes.
